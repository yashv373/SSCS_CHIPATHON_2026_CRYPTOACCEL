# CryptoAccel: ASCON AEAD128 Cryptographic Hardware Accelerator

**IEEE SSCS PICO Chipathon 2026 (Track A)** | **Target PDK:** GF180MCU

## About the Project

Team CryptoAccel proposes a fully open-source, lightweight cryptographic hardware accelerator IP implementing the ASCON128 Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm (NIST SP 800-232). Designed as a drop-in peripheral IP for modern System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures, this IP provides a unified security primitive for Root of Trust (RoT), secure boot, and IoT/Edge communication applications.

To the best of our knowledge, this project represents the first standalone ASCON cryptographic accelerator comprehensively designed, verified, and taped out on the GF180MCU PDK utilizing a 100% open-source EDA toolchain.

## Key Features

* **NIST-Standardized Security:** Implements the ASCON lightweight cryptographic standard, providing both encryption and authentication in a single core.
* **Plug-and-Play SoC Integration:** Wrapped in a standard AXI4-Lite slave interface, allowing seamless memory-mapped integration with RISC-V host processors (e.g., Ibex, PicoRV32).
* **Ultra-Low Footprint:** Built on an iterative 1-round-per-cycle permutation engine (~7 kGE), optimizing Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) for resource-constrained edge devices.
* **Open-Source RTL-to-GDSII:** Fully synthesizable Verilog design utilizing an end-to-end open-source physical design flow (Yosys, OpenROAD/OpenLane, KLayout) for a DRC/LVS-clean layout.
